REQP-1840#1 Warning
RAMB18 async control check  
The RAMB18E1 BD_i/kth_axi_rni_static_0/U0/kth_axi_rni_static_0/USER_LOGIC_I/G0.recv_buffer/HW/RAM_reg has an input control pin BD_i/kth_axi_rni_static_0/U0/kth_axi_rni_static_0/USER_LOGIC_I/G0.recv_buffer/HW/RAM_reg/ADDRARDADDR[9] (net: BD_i/kth_axi_rni_static_0/U0/kth_axi_rni_static_0/USER_LOGIC_I/G0.recv_buffer/HW/ADDRARDADDR[5]) which is driven by a register (BD_i/kth_axi_rni_static_0/U0/kth_axi_rni_static_0/USER_LOGIC_I/interface/toggle_bit_reg[0]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
